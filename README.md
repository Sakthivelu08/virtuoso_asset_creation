# Virtuoso Package Implementation
  In this repository, we have implemented the base structure of virtuoso grid and table using `react-virtuoso` package.

## Description
  `react-virtuoso` is a family of React components that display large data sets using virtualized rendering, automatically handling variable item sizes and changes in items' sizes. 
  This package offers a lot of functionalities like
  - startreached, endreached callbacks
  - fixed header content
  for both tables and grids which makes our life easier when we are handling with rendering large datasets.
